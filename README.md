## Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMo)

The [Eclipse SUMO](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/technologies/eclipse-sumo/) project is  part of the [openMobility](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/) working group.

## idea: Evaluate the use of "SUMO" to enhance our (insurance) products and services

Predicting the future within mobility is crucial: simulating this in advance is one way of prediction.

We'd evaluate what the impact of an (open-source) traffic simulation engine could have on enhancing our insurance products and services.

Furthermore we could join industry working groups (along with e.g. [BOSCH and the German Aerospace Center (and others)](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/members/)) to evaluate the needs and trends within the industry.

## scenarios
- traffic situations for accident black spots 
- optimizations for new mobility solutions e.g. commuting between cities
- individual high-risk traffic situations such as overtaking on country roads
- interaction between different upcoming traffic models (increase in public transportation, combination with local, individual mobility)

## benefits
- simplified show and tell of traffic situations
- explain / demonstrate upcoming of traffic accidents / jams
- predict current and upcoming traffic scenarios
- team up with R&D departments for experience and knowledge exchange

## aims

### stream 1: insurance
- reduce claim costs by reducing the accident rate for black spots e.g. by supporting projects to alter the current traffic situations

### stream 2: mobility
- reduce project costs for early prototype projects by simulating their potential impact and outcome

### stream 3: r&d
- build up partnerships for future projects
