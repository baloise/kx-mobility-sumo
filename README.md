## Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMo)

The [Eclipse SUMO](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/technologies/eclipse-sumo/) project is  part of the [openMobility](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/) working group.

## idea: Evaluate the use of "SUMO" to enhance our (insurance) products and services

Predicting the future within mobility is crucial: simulating this in advance is one way of prediction.

We'd evaluate what the impact of an (open-source) traffic simulation engine could have on enhancing our insurance products and services.

Furthermore we could join industry working groups (along with e.g. [BOSCH and the German Aerospace Center (and others)](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/members/)) to evaluate the needs and trends within the industry.

## scenarios
- traffic situations for accident black spots
- optimizations for new mobility solutions e.g. commuting between cities
- individual high-risk traffic situations such as overtaking on country roads
- interaction between different upcoming traffic models (increase in public transportation, combination with local, individual mobility)

## benefits
- simplified show and tell of traffic situations
- explain / demonstrate upcoming of traffic accidents / jams
- predict current and upcoming traffic scenarios
- team up with R&D departments for experience and knowledge exchange

## aims

### stream 1: insurance
- reduce claim costs by reducing the accident rate for black spots e.g. by supporting projects to alter the current traffic situations

### stream 2: mobility
- reduce project costs for early prototype projects by simulating their potential impact and outcome

### stream 3: r&d
- build up partnerships for future projects

## need narrative

For `target audience`, it’s a constant challenge to `general problem`. Each `time period`, these people `perform a key activity` in order to `achieve a primary goal`. This is especially true if you’re a `niche`.

The main problem they face is `primary functional problem relating to activity` which leads to `bad/worst case outcomes`. Today, their best option is `substitutes/concurrents`, but of course, they `the most common complaints of each substitute`. With `key trend`, the problem will only get worse over time.

If there was only a `better/easier/cheaper` way to `perform a key activity`, then customers could `quantifiable impact on their primary goal`, which would lead to `positive outcomes / emotions`. With `number of potential customers`, there is a clear opportunity to meaningfully impact a huge number of people.
