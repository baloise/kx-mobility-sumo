## idea: Evaluate the use of "simulation of urban mobility" to enhance our insurance products and services

Predicting the future within mobility is crucial: simulating this in advance is one way of prediction.

We'd evaluate what the impact of (open-source) traffic simulation engines could have on enhancing our insurance products and services.

Furthermore we could join industry working groups (along with e.g. [BOSCH and the German Aerospace Center (and others)](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/members/)) to evaluate the needs and trends within the industry.
