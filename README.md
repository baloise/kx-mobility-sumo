## Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMo)

The [Eclipse SUMO](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/technologies/eclipse-sumo/) project is  part of the [openMobility](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/) working group.

## idea
Evaluate the use of "SUMO" to enhance our (insurance) products and services

Predicting the future within mobility is crucial: simulating this in advance is one way of prediction.

We'd evaluate what the impact of an (open-source) traffic simulation engine could have on enhancing our insurance products and services.

Furthermore we could join industry working groups (along with e.g. [BOSCH and the German Aerospace Center (and others)](https://openmobility.eclipse.org/members/)) to evaluate the needs and trends within the industry.

## scenarios
- traffic situations for accident black spots
- optimizations for new mobility solutions e.g. commuting between cities
- individual high-risk traffic situations such as overtaking on country roads
- interaction between different upcoming traffic models (increase in public transportation, combination with local, individual mobility)

## benefits
- simplified show and tell of traffic situations
- explain / demonstrate upcoming of traffic accidents / jams
- predict current and upcoming traffic scenarios
- team up with R&D departments for experience and knowledge exchange

## aims

### stream 1: insurance
- reduce claim costs by reducing the accident rate for black spots e.g. by supporting projects to alter the current traffic situations

### stream 2: mobility
- reduce project costs for early prototype projects by simulating their potential impact and outcome

### stream 3: r&d
- build up partnerships for future projects

## need narrative

For `insurer`, it’s a constant challenge to `pay for mobility (accident) related claims`. Each `time`, they `pay out` in order to `cover costs for damages happened`. This is especially true if you’re a `full stack insurer`.

The main problem they face is `they only come into play after the damage has happened` which leads to `only reactive measure being taken`. Today, their best option is `to be better than others in risk calculation`, but of course, they `don't change the risk itself`. With `increase in flexible mobility demands`, the problem will only get worse over time.

If there was only a `cheaper and proactive` way to `prevent mobility related accidents to happen in the first place`, then customers would `be safer and insurer pay less for claims over time`, which would lead to `positive outcomes for both: the society and the insurer`. With `number of potential customers related to mobility insurances`, there is a clear opportunity to meaningfully impact a huge number of people.
